## Simulation of 3D phase time-series based on [`mintpy.simulation`](https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy/tree/main/src/mintpy/simulation) ##

🚨 **This toolbox is in alpha stage and undergoing rapid development.** 🚨

An example of simulating displacement, tropospheric delays, topographic residuals and phase ramps to construct a 3D raw phase time-series: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/insarlab/MintPy-tutorial/tree/main/simulations/). Handy tools for algorithm developers.
